## 🎬 Video Recording Tips
1. **Lighting:** Sit facing a window. Natural light makes you look professional.
2. **Audio:** Use a lapel mic or wired earbuds. Bad sound is the #1 reason videos are skipped.
3. **Drafting the Demo:**
   - Record the screen separately (using OBS or Loom).
   - Record your reaction/explanation separately.
   - Combine them: Your face in the corner, app taking center stage.
